                Progress toward goal (% or something)
                Recent Trend (maybe last 5 records or something, + or -) 
        Tracker - sends to a calendar tracker just for that marker 
            For discrete: marks with a red x or green x for false/true
            For range: marks with a vertical bar representing the value logged for the day
        Goals
            Sends to goals page with the markerName passed as activeMarker

    Actions: 
        Add new marker: 
            Displays "Wizard" component (from Clarity) with these steps:
                Marker Name
                Data Type (boolean, range, etc.)
                Logging Frequency
                    Daily
                    Weekly
                    Monthly
                    Custom - log this every X days
                    Goals - 
                        add goal - three parts - using a Stepper component with the currently selected value the part (also highlight that part) in the goal.text
                            to have a average score greater/less than x - graphic showing the selected value in some sort of meter or gauge
                            to make entries at least x% of the time - graphic with an example sub-"calendar" representing the required interval
                                Daily - show 3 days with green Xs
                                Every other day - show 4 days with 2 green x
                                Weekly - show compressed 2-week graphic with one green x each week
                                Monthly - etc
                                Cutom - every x days (grphically show the least number of week "rows" required to host 2 cycles of the interval, for example, once every 5 days would require 10 days, thus 2 week rows are required)
                            range: to be within x of a certain value - graphic show vertical bar with a line at the value and shaded bar representing range
                            boolean: to answer yes/no x% of the time - graphic - for a gauge (speedometer-like), where the needle is middle at 50%
                            weighted importance to score score
                            Have special entry for the master score with goal options: 
                        remove goal (if goals exist) with confirmation Modal
